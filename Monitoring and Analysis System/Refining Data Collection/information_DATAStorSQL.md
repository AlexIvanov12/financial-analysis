1. Refining Data Collection
To handle more complex data effectively, moving from simple JSON files to a database system can help. This change will facilitate better querying and handling of larger datasets.

Using SQLite for Data Storage

2. Enhancing Performance Metrics Calculations
With a database in place, you can perform more complex queries to calculate performance metrics like win rate, average profit/loss, drawdowns, and potentially risk-adjusted return measures like Sharpe ratio.

3. Improving Real-Time Monitoring Capabilities
For real-time monitoring, integrating a web-based dashboard that can display trading metrics and alerts dynamically would be beneficial. You could use a combination of Flask (a Python web framework) and Plotly Dash (for interactive dashboards).

Summary
Data Collection: Transitioned to SQLite for robust data handling.
Performance Metrics: Utilized SQL queries to derive financial metrics directly from the database.
Real-Time Monitoring: Developed a basic web dashboard using Flask and Dash that updates trading statistics in real-time.
These steps make the trading system more scalable and insightful, ready to handle complex trading scenarios and facilitate continuous improvement based on real-time data and statistical analysis.
